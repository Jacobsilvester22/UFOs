# UFOs
## Overview
Our client Dana asked us to create a webpage displaying UFO sightings from 2010. The data of the sighting came in the form of a JavaScript Array and Dana wanted a way to visual and search through the data better. She asked us to provide five different search options to parse through the data: Date, City, State, Country and Shape of the UFO.
## Results
Between the five different search option, when any are filled in the search will narrow it down further. Below is an example:

Starting off we can filter it first by date:

We see on January 2nd there are only a handful of cases, so we can further it down by shape:

Lastly, we see we have a much smaller dataset than when we originally started.
